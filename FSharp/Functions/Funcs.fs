// We use "let" to define functions, too.
let square x = x * x
// The parameters to the function follow its name, with no commas.
// The = sign starts the function body.
// There is no "return" in F#; the last expression in the function body is the return value.
// Jump to "main" below to see how to call this function.

// Note we did not define a type for x... so what type is it, and how is that determined?

// If the context of the function makes it clear, F# can infer the type of each parameter.
// In this case, F# defaults to "int" for x, because we perform x * x in the body.

// If the context is unclear, then other hints may be needed.



// Like variables, "square" has a type. Its type is "int -> int", which indicates a function
// taking an int variable and returning an int.




// Apply the given anuual interest rate to the given principal amount for the given number of years,
// then return the resulting balance.
let annualInterest principal rate numYears =
    principal * ((1.0 + rate) ** numYears)

    

// What types are the three parameters? Infer it based on the body of the function.


// The type of "interest" is float -> float -> int -> float; a function taking a float, float,
// and int; and returning float.


// Convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celcius
let toCelcius tempF = 
    (tempF - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0


// Challenges:
// Write a function that concatenates a string with itself.
// Hint: we use + for concatentation.
let doubleString s = 
    None

// Lesson: sometimes we need a type annotation.




// Write a function that returns the absolute value of an integer.
let absoluteValue x =
    None

// Lesson: "if" is an expression, not a statement.



// This "main" is technically optional; F# will execute all statements at the leftmost
// indent from top to bottom. But it's good practice, like Python's "if __name__ == '__main__'"
